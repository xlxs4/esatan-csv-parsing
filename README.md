## CSV Parse/Plot

### Usage

#### End User

Grab the binary from the [releases](https://github.com/AcubeSAT/esatan-utilities/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) page.
Make sure that the `.zip` you selected is appropriate for your platform, e.g., `windows.zip`.
Extract the archive, **navigate to the `main` directory**, and start the `main` executable.

#### Developer

Grab the repository, and make sure you have python and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed.
- `poetry lock`
- `poetry install --no-root -E build -E format` (`build` installs the dependencies needed for building the bundle, `format` installs the dependencies needed for `yapf`)
- make sure to activate the poetry environment, by sourcing the appropriate `activate` script, e.g. `activate.ps1` for Powershell, located in `.venv/Scripts/`
- for an example on how to build and format, take a look at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

<details>
<summary>Beginner-friendly details</summary>

To run the script you're going to need:

- The [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) (optional)

- Navigate to the `utilites` folder
- If you want to use `poetry` (recommended), do:
    - If it's the first time you're doing this, run `poetry install` in your terminal
    - Run `poetry shell` in your terminal
- If you *don't* want to use `poetry`, do:
    - If it's the first time you're doing this, run `source env/bin/activate` (or `.\env\Scripts\activate` if you're on Windows)
    - Run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (it might be `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead if you're on Windows)
- Execute the script by running `python3 src/main.py` (it might be `py src/main.py` if you're on Windows) in your terminal

### CI

All [CI magic](https://github.com/AcubeSAT/esatan-utilities/actions/workflows/ci.yml) happens using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
The related configuration is all located within `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

</details>

On each push, the application is bundled into a single folder containing an executable, for each OS.
This happens using [`pyinstaller`](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).
First there's a formatting check using [`yapf`](https://github.com/google/yapf).
Then, the application is built.
Everything is cached when possible.
If the job terminates successfully, the bundle folder for each OS is uploaded as an artifact that the user can download, instead of having to run `pyinstaller` locally, or having to install `python` and the project dependencies locally through `poetry`.
